# Problem

Sungwon is an 18-year-old who is deeply interested in triangles. (18 years old is still a youth, right? ðŸ˜„)  
In order for three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy **all** of the following conditions:

- `a + b > c`
- `a + c > b`
- `b + c > a`

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, determine whether these lengths can form a triangle.

# Input

The first line contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

* ($1 â‰¤ a, b, c â‰¤ 10^9$)

# Output

If the given lengths satisfy the triangle conditions, print "YESAMGHAKHYUNG". Otherwise, print "NOSAMGAKHYUK"
